# Amazon Route 53
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. We will be using Route 53 to route the incoming and outgoing HTTP traffic to our Namecheap domain that we purchased.

## Get Started with Route 53
1. Navigate to <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/home#Home" target="_blank">Amazon Route 53</a>, and click `Get Started`.
2. Select `Created hosted zones`
    1. Domain name: `example.com` (the domain you purchased from Namecheap)
    2. Description: **Direct traffic to my purchased domain name for Codeup capstones.**
    3. Type: **Public hosted zone**
    4. Click Create hosted zone!

## Namecheap Configuration
1. Navigate to your Namecheap account and click the `Manage` button next to the domain name you purchased.
2. Under the Nameservers section, change `Namecheap BasicDNS` to `Custom DNS`
    - Copy and paste all four of the nameservers that were generated by Route 53 when you created your hosted zone.
    - Click the Green Check to save!
3. This may take a few minutesâ€¦
