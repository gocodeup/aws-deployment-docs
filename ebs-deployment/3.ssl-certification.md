# AWS Certification Manager
In order for us to provide a secure connection to our application through a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate. Amazon Certification Manager allows us to request an SSL Certificate that we can attach to our domain, so that our server to server data transactions are properly encrypted.

1. Navigate to <a href="https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-2#/welcome" target="_blank">AWS Certification Manager (ACM)</a>
2. Click `Request a certificate`
    1. Certification type: **Request a public certificate**
    > Next!
    1. Fully qualified domain name: `example.com` (the domain name you purchased from Namecheap)
    2. Validation method: **DNS Validation - recommended**
    3. Key algorithm: **RSA2048**
    > Request!
3. Click `List certificates`, then click on the Certification ID to view the newly obtained certification.
4. Under `Domains` click the `Create records in Route 53` button. This will validate our SSL Certification, and attach it to our domain name.
