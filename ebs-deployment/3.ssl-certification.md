# AWS Certification Manager
In order for us to provide a secure connection to our application through a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate. AWS Certification Manager allows us to request an SSL Certificate that we can attach to our domain, so that our server to server data transactions are properly encrypted.

1. Navigate to <a href="https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-2#/welcome" target="_blank">AWS Certification Manager (ACM)</a>
2. Click `Request a certificate`
    1. Certification type: **Request a public certificate**
    2. Click Next!
    3. Fully qualified domain name: `example.com` (the domain name you purchased from Namecheap)
    4. Validation method: **DNS Validation - recommended**
    5. Key algorithm: **RSA2048**
    6. Click Request!
    > The certificate creation process may take awhile. You should see a `Pending Validation` status. Once you follow the steps below, the status should be changed to `Issued`.
3. Click `List certificates`, then click on the Certification ID to view the newly obtained certificate.
4. Under `Domains` click the `Create records in Route 53` button. This will validate our SSL Certificate, and attach it to our domain name.
