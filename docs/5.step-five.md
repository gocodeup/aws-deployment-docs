# Connecting the Server and Github

In order to keep our server and project secure, we can use another SSH keypair so that our Github Repository allows our server to clone, and pull changes.

> If you have a decoupled application with two repositories (backend & frontend), you will be using the following steps to deploy your ***backend repository***.

1. While in the server, create a new SSH key in the `.ssh` directory.
    1. `cd .ssh/`
    2. `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
    3. Name the key `ec2-to-github` (***server is configured for this name***)
    4. Press `Enter/Return` twice, to confirm an Empty Passphrase
    5. Copy the contents of the newly generated SSH key by printing it in the terminal.
        - `cat ec2-to-github.pub`
2. Navigate to your Github capstone Repository
    1. Click on the `Settings` tab
    2. On the left sidenav, click on `Deploy keys`
    3. Click `Add Deploy Key`
    4. Name the deploy key `ec2-to-github`
    5. Paste the contents of the key you copied from your terminal into the SSH key box.
3. `cd` back into the root of the server in your terminal.
4. Clone the repository using the SSH URL
    - `git clone *SSH_URL*`
