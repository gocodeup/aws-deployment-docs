# Domain Name System
1. Navigate to your Namecheap account and click the `Manage` button next to the domain name you purchased.
2. Click on the `Advanced DNS` tab, and under the Host Records section, click `Add New Record`
    - For `Type` choose the `A` record Type
    - For `Host`, enter `@`
    - For `IP address`, copy/paste the IP address listed for your AWS EC2 instance.
3. This may take a few minutesâ€¦

> ***The "A" stands for "address" and this is the most fundamental type of DNS record: it indicates the IP address of a given domain. Simply put, whenever someone visits `domain-example.net`, it will point the user to our EC2 instance server. The "@" is used as a blank record, which points the main domain to our server. If we had other webservers running, we could point them to a sub-domain, but that is unnecessary for our deployment process.***
