# Creating `application.properties` production file.
Now that we have cloned the project into our server, we need to manually add our `application.properties` file to input the correct configurations and variables.

1. Assuming you are logged into the terminal in the server, `cd` into the project root folder.
2. Open the vi editor to create a your `application.properties` file by running the follow command from the root of your project in the server terminal:
    - `vi src/main/resources/application.properties`
    - Press `i` to switch to `INSERT` mode. This will allow us to copy and paste our local `application.properties` into our terminal.
3. Copy and paste the contents of your local `application.properties` into the newly created file on your terminal.
    - Once you have pasted the contents into your new `application.properties`, hit `ESC`, then press `:wq` to write/save and quit the editor.
    > *Hint:* *Use the following command to double check that your application.properties saved, and has the correct contents!*
    >
    >    - `cat src/main/resources/application.properties`
    >
    > **NOTE:** ***If you are still using localhost as your MySQL Server host, you will need to use a remote host provided by your Instructor!!***


Next, we'll be creating a script that pm2 will utilize in order to restart our application when changes have been applied.
